In 2005, he was one of the top 24 finalists in the Algorithm Coding Competition of the International Topcoder Collegiate Challenge.     After completing college, he joined Mark Zuckerberg’s initial team that formed The Facebook as the vice-president of engineering. Later, he became the CTO.     In 2008, he retired from his job as the CTO of Facebook to create his own website.     In June 2009, he along with another ex-Facebook employee, founded their own website. It’s a platform for sharing knowledge, a question-and-answer website where users add questions, answer them, and edit and organize them.     Starting from 2010, it’s the best question-and-answer website till date. One can find answers to any question coming in mind by just searching the same.

Today the site is not only limited to a mere question-and-answer website, but it has emerged into a platform where the social media meets reality, where a damaged soul gains enlightenment.     Fortune magazine included him as a runner-up in its 'Smartest people in tech' article.  In our 20’s, when most of us are trying to figure out our life, he came up with a site that has answers to literally everything.

He is a badass programmer, has a net worth of $600 million, and is also a 0.8% stake holder of Facebook. In spite of his successful life and career, people say that he is very humble and generous in both personal and professional life.

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not… nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not… nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

ActionController::UnknownFormat (CommentsController#update is missing a template for this request format and variant.

request.formats: ["text/html"]
request.variant: []

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not… nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

ActionController::UnknownFormat (CommentsController#update is missing a template for this request format and variant.

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not… nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

Even though I have had this painting for several years, I look at it several times each day.\r\n\r\nIt is my favorite piece of original art at home in this moment because it awakens in me a sense of equilibrium, trust, power, liberation, ecstasy, virtuosity, and spirituality. There is an orgasmic quality to the oneness and surrender achieved by the Native American that allows him to “fly.”\r\n\r\nThe color blocks behind the horse and rider give the image a cosmic feeling that helps me transcend the context of the physical world. There is also a “spirit line” of geckos that you can barely see here imprinted in an arc across the image that elevates the number of dimensions you can see in it.\r\n\r\nPhrases like “peak experience” and “optimal flow” are inspired by the image. It evokes a time and a culture when Man and Nature had love and reverence for one another"], ["likes", 0], ["created_at", 2016-10-31 15:55:20 UTC], ["updated_at", 2016-10-31 15:55:20 UTC]]
