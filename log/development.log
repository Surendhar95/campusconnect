In 2005, he was one of the top 24 finalists in the Algorithm Coding Competition of the International Topcoder Collegiate Challenge.     After completing college, he joined Mark Zuckerberg’s initial team that formed The Facebook as the vice-president of engineering. Later, he became the CTO.     In 2008, he retired from his job as the CTO of Facebook to create his own website.     In June 2009, he along with another ex-Facebook employee, founded their own website. It’s a platform for sharing knowledge, a question-and-answer website where users add questions, answer them, and edit and organize them.     Starting from 2010, it’s the best question-and-answer website till date. One can find answers to any question coming in mind by just searching the same.

Today the site is not only limited to a mere question-and-answer website, but it has emerged into a platform where the social media meets reality, where a damaged soul gains enlightenment.     Fortune magazine included him as a runner-up in its 'Smartest people in tech' article.  In our 20’s, when most of us are trying to figure out our life, he came up with a site that has answers to literally everything.

He is a badass programmer, has a net worth of $600 million, and is also a 0.8% stake holder of Facebook. In spite of his successful life and career, people say that he is very humble and generous in both personal and professional life.
